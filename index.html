  <h1>This is my Blog</h1>
  <p>I'm not really sure how I want this to look yet
     and I dont want to get into the more advannce
      stuff just yet.</p>
  <h2>Todos</h2>
  <p style="text-decoration: line-through;">Over the next week I'll try to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Come up with an overall theme.</li>
    <li>Make areas for main topics.</li>
    <li>Figure out how I'm going to house blog posts.</li>
    <li>Create my first blog post!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is going to be interesting, the goal is not
    to use any frameworks to accomplish a lot of the same
    effects as a framework would. I'll see how that goes
    with the blog posts. I'm trying to take this step by
    step but I also don't want to get several weeks in only
    to realize my efforts to bypass a database are futile.
    Thus I'm planning but just a little.
  </p>
  <p>Oh, this blog is going to be about all the web development topics I explore.
    It's basically a way for me to keep track of what I learn for myself.

  <p>Look at this while I work. (I guess the color-picker can't be used in the iframe, which sort of makes sense. take a look around my <a href="https://codepen.io/djpetifo" target="_blank">codepen</a>.</p>
